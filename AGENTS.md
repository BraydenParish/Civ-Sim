# Agent Guidelines

- Work tests-first when possible; add or update automated tests alongside code changes.
- Keep diffs minimal and localized; avoid introducing new dependencies unless strictly required.
- Maintain or document key invariants in code and tests.
- Include citations in summaries referencing changed files or outputs.
- Respect existing APIs and behaviors; prefer refactors that avoid breaking changes.
